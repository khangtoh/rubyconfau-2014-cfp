# Rubytus: Resumable File Uploads with Tus.io
Users want to share more and more photos and videos. But mobile networks are fragile. Platform APIs are a mess. Every project builds its own file uploader. Tus.io is an open protocol to fix the mess that developers are facing developing APIs for mobile.

Rubytusd is a ruby gem that implements the tus server protocol that's built on top of Goliath, a non-blocking (asynchronous) Ruby web server framework by the team at [PicoCandy](http://picocandy.com).

Resumable file upload should just work in the 21st century and developers shouldn't have to worry resuming file uploads from their web  and mobile apps.
